*AI / Backend Engineer — Building LLM-powered systems*

---

I design and build backend systems and LLM-powered applications with a focus on
clarity, scalability, and real-world engineering trade-offs.

I value clean architecture, thoughtful abstractions, and systems that age well.
I also write technical articles on programming and software engineering, with an
emphasis on practical implementation over theory.
